# Webots experiment template

A template to create webots experiments.
Its utility mostly resides in the ```start_headless.sh``` script,
which allows to run the experiments in a headless mode, and therefore in a Linux server.

To start an experiment in headless mode you need to run ```./start_headless.sh main.py [OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS]```, where the optional arguments are passed to the ```main.py``` script.
